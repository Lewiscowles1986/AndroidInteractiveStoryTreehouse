# AndroidInteractiveStoryTreehouse
So, this is an Android app built in a few hours improving on the treehouse.com tutorial to build an interactive story by 
supporting more than two options, having an exit button, and using resource files to clean the whole app up and having 
validation messages if the name after trimming has a length of less than 1 (is blank / empty).

It's more of a play-around to show how easy Android development can be to get into; how to use resources instead of 
constants, without over-cooking the design. There are no databases; not API requests, no persistence. It's a pick-up and 
play game.

All graphics and original text is from Teamtreehouse. To be honest I skipped over most of what they did, and tried to mimic 
some of their choices of layout, used their graphics, but I didn't want two choices.

This implements a basic decision tree. A Model for building character data, could and should be used for a real game.
